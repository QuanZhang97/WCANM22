## Description

We present a new model of Moho depth and Vp/Vs in western Canada (i.e., *WCANM22*) by integrating existing seismic constraints from active source experiments (e.g., Lithoprobe) and new measurements from passive teleseismic data (i.e., receiver functions). Crustal properties determined from various data types are reconciled by considering the spatial coherence between sampling points using the kriging interpolation.
